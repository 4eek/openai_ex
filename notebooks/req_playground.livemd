# OpenAI Req Playground

```elixir
my_app_root = Path.join(__DIR__, "..")

Mix.install(
  [
    {:openai_ex, path: my_app_root, env: :dev}
  ],
  lockfile: Path.join(my_app_root, "mix.lock")
)
```

## Playground

This notebook uses Req to explore the OpenAI API.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### OpenAI Setup

Let's get the basic OpenAI API to work.

```elixir
apikey = System.fetch_env!("OPENAI_API_KEY")
organization = System.fetch_env!("OPENAI_ORGANIZATION")
```

```elixir
req =
  Req.new(
    base_url: "https://api.openai.com/v1",
    auth: {:bearer, apikey},
    headers: ["OpenAI-Organization": organization]
  )
```

### Models

Documentation is here https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/models/list

```elixir
models = req |> Req.get!(url: "/models") |> Map.get(:body) |> Map.get("data")
```

```elixir
names = models |> Enum.map(fn m -> m["id"] end)
```

```elixir
openai = OpenaiEx.new(apikey)

mreq = openai |> OpenaiEx.req() |> Req.get!(url: "/models")
```

```elixir
openai |> OpenaiEx.Models.list() |> Enum.map(fn m -> m["id"] end)
```

```elixir
openai |> OpenaiEx.Models.model("text-davinci-003")
```

Let's run the sample from [here]()

```elixir
completion = %{
  model: "text-davinci-003",
  temperature: 0,
  max_tokens: 100,
  stop: ["\n"]
}
```

```elixir
prompt =
  ~s(I am a highly intelligent question answering bot. If you ask me a question that is rooted in truth, I will give you the answer. If you ask me a question that is nonsense, trickery, or has no clear answer, I will respond with \"Unknown\".\n\nQ: What is human life expectancy in the United States?\nA: Human life expectancy in the United States is 78 years.\n\nQ: Who was president of the United States in 1955?\nA: Dwight D.

```

```elixir
completion = completion |> Map.put(:prompt, prompt)
```

```elixir
(req |> Req.post!(url: "/completions", json: completion)).body["choices"]
```
